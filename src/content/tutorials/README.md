# Tutorials

This directory contains tutorials showcasing different ways to build apps/sites using WPGraphQL as the data source. 

At the root of the directory is a `nav.yml` file which is responsible for organizing the hierarchy of the navigation for the Tutorials section of the site.

When a tutorial is added to the Tutorials section, it should also be added to the `nav.yml` file in the appropriate hierarchy.
