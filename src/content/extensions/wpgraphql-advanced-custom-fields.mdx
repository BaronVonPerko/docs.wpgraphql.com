title: WPGraphQL + Advanced Custom Fields
description: Expose Advanced Custom Fields in the WPGraphQL Schema
---

# Coming Soon

Right now, no official plugin exists that exposes Advanced Custom Fields to the WPGraphQL Schema.

There is one in the works, but no official timeline can be committed to currently.

In the mean-time, it's recommended to refer to the (/docs/api-reference/fields)[Fields API Reference]
to learn about exposing your custom fields to the Schema.
