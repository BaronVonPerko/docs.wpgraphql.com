---

WordPress has a `register_settings()` API that allows developers to register settings for their site. Check [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_setting/) for more information on how these settings are registered by group and name.

WPGraphQL respects this API and exposes registered settings in the WPGraphQL Schema for querying and mutating.

## Queries

### All Settings

Site settings can be queried in two different ways. As mentioned before, you register your own setting group, say `catGifSettings`, and you would see your setting group and fields appear in the GraphQL schema. You can query this data in two different ways. First, by accessing all of the site setting groups at once using the `allSettings` root query field which will return all of the settings fields with the setting group name prepended.

import GraphiQL from '../../components/GraphiQL'

<GraphiQL
  query="query {
  allSettings {
    generalSettingsDateFormat
    generalSettingsDescription
    generalSettingsEmail
    generalSettingsLanguage
    generalSettingsStartOfWeek
    generalSettingsTimeFormat
    generalSettingsTimezone
    generalSettingsTitle
    generalSettingsUrl
    readingSettingsPostsPerPage
    discussionSettingsDefaultCommentStatus
    discussionSettingsDefaultPingStatus
    writingSettingsDefaultCategory
    writingSettingsDefaultPostFormat
    writingSettingsUseSmilies
  }
}"
/>

### Site Settings by Settings Group

Site settings can also be queried by setting group name. Field names will be the camel case version of the setting, no longer prepended by the group name since you are using it to query with.

#### General Settings

<GraphiQL
  query="query{generalSettings {
  dateFormat
  description
  email
  language
  startOfWeek
  timeFormat
  timezone
  title
  url
}}"
/>

#### Reading Settings

<GraphiQL
  query="query{readingSettings {
    postsPerPage
}}"
/>

#### Discussion Settings

<GraphiQL
  query="query{discussionSettings {
  defaultCommentStatus
  defaultPingStatus
}}"
/>

#### Writing Settings

<GraphiQL
  query="query{writingSettings {
  defaultCategory
  defaultPostFormat
  useSmilies
}}"
/>
