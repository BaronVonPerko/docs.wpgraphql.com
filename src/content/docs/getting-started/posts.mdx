Posts are at the heart of WordPress. On this page, we'll take a look at various ways to interact with
Posts using WPGraphQL.

## Query Posts

In this example, we query a list of Post nodes. By default, WPGraphQL will return 10 items.

<GraphiQL
    query='
    {
      posts {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    '
/>

<Note title="What's up with edges and nodes?" type="info">
One of the first things you may ask when you see this is: <strong><em>"What in the world are
'edges' and 'nodes'?"</em></strong>.

We've written up a guide on what they are and why WPGraphQL makes use of this shape of data throughout.

### Pagination

When querying a list of nodes (Posts), it's common to need to paginate to fetch more items. The
Schema exposes some helpful fields we can ask for to know if there are more items to fetch.

#### pageInfo

Here, you can see that we ask for the field `pageInfo`, and on that we ask for `hasNextPage` and
`endCursor`.

The `hasNextPage` field will be either `true` or `false`, and the `endCursor` will be an opaque string
that acts as a reference to the last node returned in the query.

The cursor can then be used as an argument in a follow-up query, to ask for posts `after` that point
in the dataset.

<GraphiQL
    query='
    {
      posts {
        pageInfo {
          hasNextPage
          endCursor
        }
        edges {
          cursor
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    '
/>


#### first

We can use the `first` argument to declare how many items we want from the "front" of the dataset.
In this case, we're telling WPGraphQL we want the first 5 most recent posts.

<GraphiQL
    query='
    {
      posts(first: 5) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    '
/>

#### after

The `after` argument is to be used in conjunction with the `first` argument for pagination purposes.

When querying for a list of posts, it's common to need to paginate. When we ask for the first `10`
posts, there's a good chance we'll want to ask for the _first_ `10` posts _after_ the final post in
that list.

#### last

We can use the `last` argument to declare how many items we want from the "back" of the dataset. In
this case, we're telling WPGraphQL we want the last 5 (oldest) posts.

<GraphiQL
    query='
    {
      posts(last: 5) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    '
/>

### Using Arguments

In many cases, exactly 10 posts won't be what you need for your application. So we can use arguments
on the `posts` field to declare how many items we want.

### whereArgs

Post connections can be further filtered by using `whereArgs`.

The args available are largely similar to what's available (and end up mapping to) to the underlying
[WP_Query](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query). We'll look at a few quick examples,
but it's probably best for you to spend some time exploring the Schema Docs to see what options are
available.

Also, keep in mind that the entire WPGraphQL Schema is filterable should you need to extend the
Schema and provide custom arguments for your applications needs.

<GraphiQL
    query='
    {
      posts(where: { dateQuery: {
        day: 10
        month: 1
        year: 2019
      }}) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            date
          }
        }
      }
    }
    '
