On this page, we'll look at some of the features of the GraphQL specification and Query Language.
After reading this page, you should have a basic understanding of how to interact with a WPGraphQL
server.

## Queries

To get started understanding GraphQL, it's best to look at an example of a GraphQL Query.

### Hello World

This is essentially the "hello world" of GraphQL queries for a site running WPGraphQL. This query
asks for `generalSettings`, and on `generalSettings`, it's asking for the field `url`.

```graphql
{
 generalSettings {
   url
 }
}
```
The response to this query would look like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "generalSettings": {
      "url": "https://www.wpgraphql.com"
    }
  }
}
```

We can see that the results match the shape of the query. We get exactly what we asked for, and
nothing more. This is a huge feature! Not only does this **give clients control** by asking for the
exact data they need, it means the **data is predictable** which can lead to **fewer bugs** in your
applications, it means the **data download sizes are smaller** because it only includes the specified
fields, and it also means the **server can be more efficient** as it can do the minimum work necessary
to get the data the client asked for.

### Interactive GraphiQL IDE

Let's take a look at the same query in an interactive GraphQL IDE.

<Note>
Throughout this guide, you will see this embedded GraphiQL editor which allows you to execute real
GraphQL queries against a live WordPress site running WPGraphQL.

Click the pulsating red dot to take a tour of the GraphiQL editor.
</Note>

<GraphiQL
    query="
    {
     generalSettings {
       url
     }
    }
    "
    showJoyride={true}
    withDocs={false}
/>

## Exploring the Schema

Ok, cool, we can query for the url of the site, but what else can we do with GraphQL? How can we find
out what other data is available to query?

### Schema Docs

<Note title="Documentation Explorer" type="info">
One of the easiest ways to explore what is available to be queried, is by exploring the Schema using
the Documentation explorer in GraphiQL.
</Note>

**Go ahead, click the "Docs" button, then explore by typing in the "search schema" field, or clicking
on fields or types**

<GraphiQL
    query="
    {
     generalSettings {
       url
     }
    }
    "
    withDocs={true}
    showJoyride={'docsOnly'}
/>

<Note type="warning">
Note: Not all instances of the interactive GraphiQL editor in these docs will have the Documentation
explorer available to keep distractions to a minimum as you work through examples.
</Note>

### Self-documenting Schema

Since GraphQL is built on a strong [Type](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#type-system) system the
Schema is self-documenting and queryable, meaning you can query the Schema itself!

The Schema is self-documenting, meaning that as you register Fields and Types to the Schema, you
can provide descriptions in the definitions and those are exposed to the Schema for documentation
purposes.

The Schema is queryable, meaning that it's not just one static thing. You can query the Schema as
an interactive thing. Here's an example:

<GraphiQL
  query="
  {
    __schema {
      types {
        fields {
          name
          type {
            kind
          }
          description
        }
      }
    }
  }
  "
/>
