description: Learn about how to register and interact with Custom Post Types using WPGraphQL
---

Exposing Custom Post Types to GraphQL requires just 3 fields to be added to the Post Type registration.

- **show_in_graphql**: true or false
- **graphql_single_name**: camel case string with no punctuation or spaces
- **graphql_plural_name**: camel case string with no punctuation or spaces

## Register a new Post Type

This is an example of registering a new “docs” post_type and enabling GraphQL support.

```php
add_action( 'init', function() {
   register_post_type( 'docs', [
      'show_in_graphql' => true,
      'hierarchical' => true,
      'graphql_single_name' => 'Document',
      'graphql_plural_name' => Documents',
   ] );
} );
```

## Filter Existing Post Types

If you want to expose a Post Type that you don’t control the registration for, such as a post type
registered in a third-party plugin, you can filter the Post Type registration like so:

```php
add_filter( 'register_post_type_args', function( $args, $post_type ) {

	if ( 'docs' === $post_type ) {
		$args['show_in_graphql'] = true;
		$args['graphql_single_name'] = 'Document';
		$args['graphql_plural_name'] = 'Documents';
	}

	return $args;

}, 10, 2 );
```

## Interacting with Custom Post Types

Once your Post Type is registered to Show in GraphQL, you will be able to interact with it in the
same way you can interact with Posts or Pages, of course just using the name of the Type in place.

For example, a query for Documents based on the example code above might look like:

```graphql
query GET_DOCUMENTS {
  documents {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
        date
      }
    }
  }
}
```
