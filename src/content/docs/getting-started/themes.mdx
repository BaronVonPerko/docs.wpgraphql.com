## Mutations

Right now there are no Mutations related to Themes.

If anyone feels that adding mutations for themes, such as changing the active theme, installing new
themes, or deleting themes should be added to WPGraphQL,
[open an issue](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues) and let's discuss.
