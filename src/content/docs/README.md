# Docs

This directory contains documentation for the WPGraphQL plugin. 

At the root of the directory is a `nav.yml` file which is responsible for organizing the hierarchy of the navigation for the docs section of the site.

When a page is added to the documentation, it should also be added to the `nav.yml` file in the appropriate hierarchy.
