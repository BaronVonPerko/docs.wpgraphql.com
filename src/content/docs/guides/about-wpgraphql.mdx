## About GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a [spec](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/) for a Query Language for application data graphs. GraphQL isn’t tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data. As GraphQL is a spec, there are implementations in [nearly every language](https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql#lib), and for many different systems.

GraphQL is centered around a strongly typed [Schema](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/). The GraphQL Schema is composed of [Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#type-system), and Types are composed of [fields](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields). Fields are defined with Type that they should resolve to. Field’s can be defined as a [Scalar](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types) Type (string, integer, boolean, float), or another Type.

These concepts might be hard to grasp right now, but as you continue exploring the docs, they should start to make more sense.

## How WPGraphQL Brings GraphQL to WordPress

WPGraphQL is built atop the [GraphQL-PHP](http://webonyx.github.io/graphql-php/) library and provides an executable, extendable Schema and resolvers for your WordPress site.

WPGraphQL takes advantages of the various static registries in WordPress, such as the Post Type, Taxonomy and Settings registries to build a Schema for your WordPress site.
