Resolvers can be overridden by applying the `graphql_resolve_field` WordPress filter. Arguments available for the callback function are:


* `$result`         The result of the field resolution.
* `$source`         The source passed down the Resolve Tree.
* `$args`           The args for the field.
* `$context`        The AppContext passed down the ResolveTree.
* `$info`           The ResolveInfo passed down the ResolveTree.
* `$type_name`      The name of the type the fields belong to.
* `$field_key`      The name of the field.
* `$field`          The Field Definition for the resolving field.
* `$field_resolver` The default field resolver.

For example, the following code overrides the resolved value for the `title` field of all _Event_ posts.

```
add_filter(
	'graphql_resolve_field', function( $result, $source, $args, $context, $info, $type_name, $field_key, $field, $field_resolver ) {
		if ( strpos( $context->currentConnection, 'RootQueryToEventConnection' ) !== false
			&& 'Event' === $type_name
			&& 'title' === $field_key ) {
			$result = 'My super awesome title override!';
		}

		return $result;
	}, 20, 9
);
```

Alternately, you can apply the `graphql_event_fields` filter to override a particular field of all post types.

```
add_filter(
	'graphql_event_fields', function( $fields ) {
		if ( isset( $fields['title'] ) ) {
			$fields['title']['resolve'] = function( $post ) {
				return 'YO!';
			};
		}

		return $fields;
	}, 20, 1
);
```
